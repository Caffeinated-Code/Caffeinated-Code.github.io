summary: Assisted Prof. Chesley Leslin in conducting and evaluating lab hours, assignments and quizzes for a class of 30 students.
---


My primary responsibilities are to conduct lab hours, answer doubts and grade assignments for a class of 30 students. I have written and implemented scripts to automatically grade every studentâ€™s assignment and produce a score card, which helped save a lot of time and effort.



```js
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
